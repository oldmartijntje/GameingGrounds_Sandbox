Limbo is an enchantment you can put on swords. When you hit an entity it will disappear and leave a flame in their place. They will be sent to their correct Nether coordinates somewhere between Y32 and Y128. It will make sure you are not in a wall, and it will place a block of magma below them. This enchantment was added in [[Release 1.0.0|the first release]].
