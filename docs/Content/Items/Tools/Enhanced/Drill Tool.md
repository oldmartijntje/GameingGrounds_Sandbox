- Added in version: [[Release 1.0.0|Release 1.0.0]]

The drill tool was added because the bedrock breaking method in vanilla is tedious and annoying.
The drill won't make it cheaper though, it will still cost the same as [this bedrock breaking method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PNdyvUwj0):

You use the drill by clicking on bedrock. This will give it 2HP damage. You can click it on a TNT block to remove the TNT and add 1HP back onto the tool.
Clicking bedrock with 1HP left will work. 
It will only have 2/32HP when you craft it.
